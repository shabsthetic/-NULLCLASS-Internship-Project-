NULLCLASS Internship Project
This repository contains the code and resources from my internship at NULLCLASS, focusing on data visualization, analysis, and responsive web design. It includes source files, scripts, and project-related assets.

The following datasets have been used:

The "Job Dataset" (CSV) was used for Task 5.
The "Intern Account Director CSV 2023" was used for Task 3.
An additional CSV dataset was sourced from Kaggle FOR OTHER 3 TASKS:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset
